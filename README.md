The Number Guessing Game is a fun Java-based project where the computer randomly generates a number between 1 and 100. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number. The game provides feedback if the guess is too high or low and allows the player to quit anytime by typing "quit". With each round, the player earns points based on the number of attempts used. This project demonstrates Java concepts such as loops, conditionals, input validation, and scoring systems.

## Files And Their Detailed Description -
### NumberGuessingGame.java
Main class that handles the game logic, including number generation, user input, feedback, and scoring. It limits the number of attempts and provides the option to quit.

### Main.java
Serves as the entry point for the application. It integrates the game logic and manages the round flow, prompting the player for guesses and tracking the score.

## Future Enhancements
Add difficulty levels with varying ranges for numbers.
Implement a timer for each round.
Store high scores in a file or database.
Improve user interface (e.g., using JavaFX).
